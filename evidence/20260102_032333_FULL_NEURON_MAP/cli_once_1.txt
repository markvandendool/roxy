🎤 You: 🤖 ROXY: ⚠️  FILE VERIFICATION FAILED

I cannot make claims about specific files without verification.

**Unverified file mentions:** `docs/governance/CANONICAL_GOVERNANCE.md`

❌ **Why blocked:**
- No list_files, search_code, or git_log tools executed
- Cannot verify these files exist in your codebase
- Prevents "roxy_assistant.py" style fabrications (Chief's requirement)

✅ **What you can do:**
- Ask me to list files first: "list files in ~/.roxy"
- Then ask specific questions about verified files
- Or use tool forcing: `{"tool": "list_files", "args": {"directory": "path"}}`

🔒 **Truth Gate:** Blocked to prevent file fabrication hallucination.
