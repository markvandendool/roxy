# Authentic Content Strategy: BackstageTech
## "Clueless Guy Learning AI Workflows" - Real Journey Documentation

### Brand Positioning
**Who**: Guitar teacher turned AI/automation experimenter  
**What**: Documenting real struggles, sharing what actually worked  
**Why People Care**: Everyone else sells perfect solutions. You show the failures.

### Content Format Strategy

#### Video Structure (All Platforms)
1. **Hook (3s)**: Show the failure/problem
2. **Story (10s)**: "Here's what I tried..."
3. **Solution (10s)**: "This actually worked"
4. **CTA (2s)**: "Full setup in bio" (Gumroad link)

#### Platform-Specific Tweaks
- **YouTube Shorts**: More technical detail, longer hooks
- **TikTok**: Faster cuts, text overlays for soundless viewing
- **Twitter**: Thread format, code snippets as images
- **Reddit**: Long-form writeups in r/selfhosted, r/LocalLLaMA, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers

### Monetization Hooks (Subtle)

**Don't sell. Show.**
- End screens: "Full code: link in bio"
- Pin comment: "Setup guide (free): [Gumroad]"
- Video description: "If this saved you time, the starter kit has 6 more scripts like this: [link]"

**Product Positioning:**
- Not "Buy my course"
- Instead: "Here's what I use. You can copy it."

### Anti-AI-Slop Tactics (Built In)

✅ **Real failures documented**: Show the broken terminal output, the kernel panics  
✅ **Personal voice**: "I'm an idiot who tried this 47 times"  
✅ **Actual tools**: Link to GitHub, show real code, not stock footage  
✅ **Engage first**: Reply to comments, ask questions before posting  
✅ **Varied timing**: Post TikTok at 2:15pm, 7:43pm, 9:21am (not on the hour)  
✅ **Platform slang**: TikTok "fy", Reddit "TIL", Twitter "thread 🧵"  

### Content Calendar (Week 1)

**Monday**: Video 1 (GPU Monitoring) → TikTok 2pm, YouTube 8pm  
**Tuesday**: Engage on Reddit (r/selfhosted), reply to comments  
**Wednesday**: Video 2 (OBS Automation) → TikTok 3pm, YouTube 9pm  
**Thursday**: Twitter thread (expansion of Video 1)  
**Friday**: Video 3 (Faceless Videos) → TikTok 11am, YouTube 7pm  
**Weekend**: Reddit long-form (GPU setup guide), engage on TikTok  

### Honest Assessment

**Why This Beats Fake Accounts:**
- You have real receipts (crash logs, working code, actual infrastructure)
- Guitar + tech fusion = underserved niche
- "Learning in public" is the meta (see Pieter Levels, Danny Thompson, Swyx)
- Your failures are more valuable than others' successes
- The product becomes a byproduct, not the point

**What Could Go Wrong:**
- Imposter syndrome ("Who am I to teach?") → You're 10 steps ahead of most
- Burnout from consistency → Start with 2-3 videos/week, not daily
- Platform algorithm changes → Focus on evergreen (how-tos, not trends)

**Next Steps:**
1. Pick brand name (BackstageTech, RiffStack, or keep it simple: "Mark's Tech Chaos")
2. Record Video 1 (GPU monitoring) using actual roxy-monitor-evidence footage
3. Create ProtonMail account with chosen brand
4. Upload to TikTok/YouTube with authentic caption
5. Engage before selling (reply to 10 comments on similar videos)

## Brand Name Options (Updated for Authenticity)

1. **BackstageTech** ← My pick
   - Username: @backstage.tech
   - Vibe: "The unglamorous tech behind creative work"
   
2. **RiffStack** 
   - Username: @riffstack
   - Vibe: "Guitar riffs meet tech stacks"
   
3. **Mark's Tech Chaos**
   - Username: @markstechchaos
   - Vibe: Ultra-authentic, self-deprecating
   
4. **CreatorInfra**
   - Username: @creatorinfra
   - Vibe: "Infrastructure for creators who hate infrastructure"

**Recommendation: BackstageTech**  
Why: Captures both worlds (music backstage + backend tech), sounds professional but approachable, natural content angles ("backstage look at my automation", "behind the scenes of my studio stack")
