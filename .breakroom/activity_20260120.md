## Session: OBS WebSocket Control & PipeWire Fix

### Accomplishments
1. **Fixed PipeWire crash** - Audio system was down 14+ hours, causing OBS Settings freeze
2. **Fixed OBS profile** - Duplicate `[AdvOut]` section was causing silent recording failures
3. **OBS WebSocket fully operational** - Port 4455, password auth
4. **Created 7 scenes programmatically** - HDMI-1 through HDMI-4, Quad-View, Screen-Capture
5. **Created `obs-control.py`** - CLI script for OBS control
6. **Created `OBS_CONTROL_GUIDE.md`** - Full engineering reference for agents

### Key Files
- `~/.roxy/obs-control.py` - CLI control script
- `~/.roxy/docs/OBS_CONTROL_GUIDE.md` - Engineering guide
- `~/.roxy/docs/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with OBS reference

### Quick Commands
```bash
~/.roxy/obs-control.py status
~/.roxy/obs-control.py scenes
~/.roxy/obs-control.py record start/stop
```

### Python API
```python
import obsws_python as obs
cl = obs.ReqClient(host='localhost', port=4455, password='nikkisixx')
cl.set_current_program_scene(name='Quad-View')
cl.start_record()
```

### Root Causes Fixed
1. PipeWire custom config referenced nonexistent device
2. OBS profile had duplicate INI section
