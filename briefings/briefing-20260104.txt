"Good morning, Mark! Hope you're doing well. I wanted to start with the good stuff - our MRR is up 8.5% from last month, at $12,500. That's a great sign of our growth momentum.

On the student front, we currently have 156 active students, and I've got my eye on 8 who are at risk of dropping out. I'll be monitoring their progress closely to ensure we can support them better.

Content-wise, we're looking good too - we've got 14 clips ready to go, and 21 scheduled for the next quarter. That's a solid foundation for our marketing efforts.

In terms of product development, we've got three open PRs to tackle, with v0.4.0 on the horizon. And as you know, our calendar is busy - we've got two meetings lined up today, including our team sync at 10:00 AM.

So, what would you like to focus on first?"
