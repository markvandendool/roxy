Hey Mark! Roxy here, and I've got your morning briefing ready to go.

First off, great job on the MRR front - we're seeing 8.5% growth, which is fantastic news! That's a total of $12,500 coming in, so let's keep that momentum going.

On the student side, we've got 156 active learners, with 8 who are at-risk and might need some extra attention. Our content team has got 14 clips ready to roll, and another 21 scheduled for release soon.

In terms of products, I'm keeping an eye on three open PRs and looking forward to the next release of our software, v0.4.0 - it's shaping up to be a big update.

Finally, take note that you've got two meetings today: first one at 10:00 AM is your team sync, so make sure to clear your schedule for that.

That's all for now, Mark! What would you like to focus on first?
