Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, our MRR is looking great - a 8.5% growth from last month's numbers, bringing us up to $12,500. That's a fantastic start to the day!

On the student front, we're currently at 156 active learners, with 8 of them showing some signs of being at-risk. Our team will be discussing these students in our first meeting today at 10:00 AM.

Content-wise, we've got 14 clips ready to go and 21 scheduled for release. That's a lot of great material coming up!

In product land, we're keeping an eye on three open PRs and gearing up for our next release, v0.4.0.

Last but not least, your calendar is looking busy today with two meetings - that first one at 10:00 AM being the team sync.

So, Mark, what would you like to focus on first?
