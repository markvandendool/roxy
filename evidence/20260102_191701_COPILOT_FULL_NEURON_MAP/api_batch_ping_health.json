I'm happy to help. Since you didn't specify a particular question, I'll provide general information based on the provided contexts.\n\nTo get started, it seems like there are some diagnostic steps and testing procedures outlined in the contexts (e.g., Context 1, Context 4). These might be helpful for understanding or troubleshooting certain issues.\n\nIf you're looking to translate Cursor Plan Mode documents into swarm-executable ticket JSON (Context 2), it appears that this process is well-defined and requires following the CORE RULE: all work must be represented as a swarm ticket JSON that conforms to the contract. There's also a field mapping table provided for translating plan documents into tickets.\n\nFor first-day activities, Contexts 3 and 5 seem to suggest some initial tasks, such as completing onboarding steps or running diagnostics tests.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or concerns, and I'll do my best to provide more targeted answers!\n\n\ud83d\udccc Source: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - 5 context chunks"}], "total": 2, "response_time": 4.599}
