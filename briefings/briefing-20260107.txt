Good morning, Mark! Hope you're doing well. I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, let's start with the good news - our MRR is up 8.5% from last month, hitting $12,500. That's a great indicator of our momentum and growth.

Moving on to active students, we currently have 156 enrolled, which is an increase from last quarter. However, I want to highlight that we're monitoring 8 students who are at-risk of dropping out. We'll need to keep a close eye on these individuals and provide extra support if needed.

On the content front, we've got 14 clips ready to go live, and another 21 scheduled for release in the coming weeks. Our pipeline is looking strong!

In terms of product development, we have three open PRs, and our next release candidate is v0.4.0. I'll make sure to keep you updated on any progress.

Finally, let's take a look at your calendar - two meetings scheduled for today, starting with the team sync at 10:00 AM. You're all set!

That's it for now, Mark. What would you like to focus on first?
