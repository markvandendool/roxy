Good morning, Mark! I've got your daily briefing ready.

First off, let me highlight that our MRR is up 8.5% from last month, which is fantastic news. We're seeing a consistent growth trend, and it's great to see the efforts paying off.

On the student front, we have 156 active learners currently enrolled, with 8 students who are at-risk of dropping out. Let's keep an eye on them and make sure they get the support they need.

In terms of content, we're all set for the next batch of clips - we've got 14 ready to go and 21 scheduled in the pipeline. That's a great foundation for our marketing efforts going forward.

On the product side, we have three open PRs that need attention. The next release, v0.4.0, is just around the corner, so let's make sure we're on top of those issues before it drops.

Finally, take note of your calendar - you've got a team sync meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM today. Make sure to clear your schedule and join in.

That's a quick rundown of the current state of affairs, Mark. What would you like to focus on first?
