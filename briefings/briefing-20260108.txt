Hey Mark! Morning! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, let's start with the good stuff - our MRR is looking healthy, up 8.5% from last month at $12,500. That's a solid foundation for us to build on!

On the student side, we're currently at 156 active students, and I've flagged eight of them as being at-risk. We'll need to keep a close eye on those folks and make sure they're getting the support they need.

Content-wise, we're looking good with 14 ready-to-go clips and 21 scheduled for the next batch. Our pipeline is full!

Product development is moving forward too - we've got three open PRs and are gearing up for the next release, v0.4.0. That's some exciting stuff on the horizon!

Finally, let's talk about today's calendar. We've got a team sync scheduled for 10:00 AM, so make sure to clear your schedule.

So, what would you like to focus on first?
