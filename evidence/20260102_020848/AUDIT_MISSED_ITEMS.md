---

## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS FOUND

### 1. **Cursor's New Modules - Integration Status UNVERIFIED**

**Files Created**: ✅ Confirmed
- `rag/hybrid_search.py` (186 lines, 6.3K)
- `llm_router.py` (154 lines, 5.4K)
- `feedback.py` (136 lines, 4.7K)
- `security.py` (181 lines, 6.2K)

**Integration Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY INTEGRATED**

#### 1.1 Hybrid Search Integration
**Claim**: Integrated in `roxy_commands.py` query_rag()
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from rag.hybrid_search import get_hybrid_search`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 440-515 in roxy_commands.py
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification that hybrid search actually runs
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No test that reranking improves results
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No fallback verification if rank-bm25 not installed

**Gap**: Code exists but execution path not proven. Could fail silently if dependencies missing.

#### 1.2 LLM Router Integration
**Claim**: Integrated in `roxy_commands.py` query_rag()
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from llm_router import get_llm_router`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 558-573 in roxy_commands.py
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification that router actually selects different models
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No test that code queries route to code models
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification of model discovery (Ollama API call)

**Gap**: Router code exists but model selection logic not verified. Could default to same model for all queries.

#### 1.3 Security Integration
**Claim**: Integrated in `roxy_core.py` _handle_run_command()
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from security import get_security`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 231-243 (input), 261-271 (output) in roxy_core.py
- ✅ **PROVEN**: Security blocks dangerous commands (403 responses in tests)
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification of PII detection/masking
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification of prompt injection detection
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No audit log verification

**Gap**: Core security works, but advanced features (PII, injection) not tested.

#### 1.4 Feedback Integration
**Claim**: Integrated in `roxy_client.py` main loop
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from feedback import get_feedback_collector`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 186-210 in roxy_client.py
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification that feedback files are created
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification of feedback statistics
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No test of feedback learning/analysis

**Gap**: Code exists but feedback collection not verified. Could fail silently.

---

### 2. **Error Recovery Integration - INCOMPLETE**

**Claim**: Error recovery integrated in `roxy_commands.py` query_rag()
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from error_recovery import get_error_recovery`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 399-428 in roxy_commands.py
- ❌ **MISSING**: Error recovery wrapper is broken!

**Critical Bug Found**:
```python
# Line 399-428: Broken error recovery pattern
def _query_rag_impl(query, n_results=5, use_advanced_rag=False):
    # ... implementation ...

# Line 399: Wrapper tries to call _query_rag_impl with wrong signature
return error_recovery.execute_with_fallback(
    _query_rag_impl,  # Primary function
    _query_with_fallback,  # Fallback function
    query, n_results, use_advanced_rag  # Args - WRONG!
)
```

**Problem**: `execute_with_fallback` expects `(*args, **kwargs)` but passes positional args. The fallback function `_query_with_fallback` is defined inside try block and may not be accessible.

**Gap**: Error recovery code exists but is likely non-functional due to incorrect function signature.

---

### 3. **Validation Gates Integration - PARTIAL**

**Claim**: Validation gates integrated in `roxy_core.py` _validate_response()
**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Import exists: `from validation.fact_checker import FactChecker`
- ✅ Code exists: Lines 423-466 in roxy_core.py
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification that validation actually runs
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No test that validation catches hallucinations
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification of confidence scoring

**Gap**: Validation code exists but execution not proven. Could be silently failing.

---

### 4. **Truth Gate Integration - STATUS UNKNOWN**

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ File exists: `truth_gate.py` (not broken version)
- ✅ Import in roxy_core.py: Lines 57-64, 67-74 (duplicate import!)
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No verification that Truth Gate actually validates
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: No test that Truth Gate prevents hallucinations
- ⚠️ **MISSING**: Duplicate import suggests confusion about which version to use

**Gap**: Truth Gate exists but validation logic not verified. Duplicate imports suggest uncertainty.

---

### 5. **OBS Launcher - FALSE ROUTING CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
- ✅ Command "open obs" routes to obs handler
- ✅ Obs handler calls `obs_controller.py` (WebSocket client)
- ❌ **CONFIRMED**: Does NOT launch OBS application
- ❌ **MISSING**: No `gtk-launch obs` or similar launch mechanism
- ❌ **MISSING**: No verification that OBS can be launched via ROXY

**Gap**: Command implies launch but only does WebSocket control. This is misleading UX.

---

### 6. **Timeout Configuration - INCONSISTENT**

**Evidence Found**:
- `roxy_core.py`: subprocess timeout=30 (line 326)
- `roxy_commands.py`: subprocess timeout=120 (line 68)
