Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, our MRR is looking strong, up 8.5% from last month at $12,500. That's a great start to the day!

On the student front, we're currently sitting at 156 active learners, with 8 of them showing some concerning signs. Let's make sure we keep an eye on those students and provide the support they need.

In terms of content, we've got 14 clips ready to go, and another 21 scheduled for release soon. That should give us a solid pipeline moving forward.

On the product side, we're working through three open PRs, with the next major release v0.4.0 on the horizon. Exciting times ahead!

Looking at your calendar, you've got two meetings lined up today - first one's at 10:00 AM for our team sync. Make sure to block that time out.

That's a quick rundown of what's happening in our world. What would you like to focus on first?
