Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, let's start with the good stuff - our MRR is up 8.5% from last month, at $12,500. That's a great way to kick things off!

Now, moving on to student engagement: we're currently sitting at 156 active students, and I've flagged 8 as being at-risk. We should touch base with the support team to discuss strategies for reaching out and keeping them engaged.

On the content front, we've got 14 clips ready to go and 21 more scheduled in the pipeline. That's a lot of great material to share with our students!

Product-wise, we've got three open PRs to tackle, and our next release is looking like v0.4.0. I'll make sure to keep an eye on those.

Finally, let's take a look at your calendar: you've got two meetings scheduled - the first one being our team sync at 10:00 AM. I've got everything set up for that one.

So, what would you like to focus on first?
