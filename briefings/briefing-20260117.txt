Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, let's start with some great news - our MRR is up 8.5% from last month, which is fantastic! We're now at $12,500, and that growth is a testament to the hard work our team has been putting in.

Moving on to our active students, we've got 156 learners currently engaged with our content. I do want to note that we've got eight students who are at-risk of falling behind, so let's make sure we're keeping an eye on them and providing any extra support they might need.

Speaking of content, we've got 14 clips ready to go and 21 more scheduled in the pipeline. That's a lot of great learning material to share with our community!

In product news, we've got three open PRs and are gearing up for our next release, which is looking like it'll be v0.4.0.

Finally, just a quick glance at your calendar - you've got two meetings lined up today, the first one being our team sync at 10:00 AM.

So, what would you like to focus on first?
