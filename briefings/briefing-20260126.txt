"Good morning, Mark! I've got a quick briefing for you before we dive into the day. The biggest news is that our monthly recurring revenue has reached $12,500, which is an impressive 8.5% growth from last month. That's a great indicator of our momentum.

On the student front, we're currently at 156 active students, with 8 who are showing signs of being at-risk. I've got some ideas on how to reach out and support them, but I'd love your input on that.

In terms of content, we're looking good - we've got 14 clips ready to go and another 21 scheduled for the coming weeks. That should keep our students engaged and excited about what's next.

On the product side, we've got three open PRs and are gearing up for the next release, v0.4.0. I'll make sure to keep you updated on any major developments there.

Finally, a quick glance at the calendar shows we've got two meetings today, with our team sync kicking off at 10:00 AM. That's it in brief! What would you like to focus on first?"
