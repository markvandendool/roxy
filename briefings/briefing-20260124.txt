Good morning, Mark! Hope you're having a great start to your day. I've got a quick briefing for you. First off, our MRR is looking healthy - $12,500 and 8.5% growth, which is fantastic news. That's the kind of momentum we love to see.

On the student front, we've got 156 active students, with 8 flagged as at-risk. We'll want to keep a close eye on those numbers, but overall, things are looking good.

Content-wise, we're in great shape - 14 clips ready to go and 21 more scheduled for release. That's a lot of value being created!

In the product realm, we've got three open PRs and our next release is v0.4.0. We'll want to keep an eye on those PRs to make sure everything stays on track.

Finally, your calendar looks busy today - two meetings, with our team sync at 10:00 AM being the first one. I'm all set for that meeting, by the way.

That's a quick rundown of what's happening around here, Mark. What would you like to focus on first?
