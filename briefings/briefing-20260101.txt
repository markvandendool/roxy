Good morning, Mark! Hope you're doing well.

Let's get straight to the highlights. Our MRR is looking strong, up 8.5% from last month at $12,500. That's a great way to start the day!

On the student front, we've got 156 active learners, with 8 who are at-risk of falling behind. Let's make sure we're keeping an eye on them and providing the support they need.

In terms of content, we're all set for this week – 14 clips ready to go, with another 21 scheduled to be released in the coming days. Our pipeline is looking good!

On the product side, we've got three open PRs waiting to be addressed, and our next release, v0.4.0, is just around the corner.

Looking at your calendar, you've got a team sync meeting scheduled for 10:00 AM today. Make sure you're prepared to dive in and tackle some important topics with the team.

That's the update for now! What would you like to focus on first?
