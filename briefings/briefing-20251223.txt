Good morning, Mark! I've got your daily briefing ready.

First off, great job on our MRR growth - we're at $12,500 this month, an 8.5% increase from last time. That's fantastic momentum!

On the active students front, we're looking healthy with 156 students currently enrolled. However, there are eight students who are at-risk of dropping out, so let's make sure to keep a close eye on them.

Moving on to content, we've got 14 clips ready to go and 21 more scheduled for release in the coming weeks. That's a lot of engaging material to share with our audience!

As for product development, we're still working through three open PRs, but our next major release, v0.4.0, is just around the corner.

On the calendar front, you've got two meetings scheduled today - the first one's at 10:00 AM, a team sync to catch everyone up on the latest developments.

What would you like to focus on first?
