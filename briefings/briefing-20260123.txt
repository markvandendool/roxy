Good morning, Mark! Roxy here, your trusty AI sidekick.

I've got a great start to the day for you. Our MRR is looking strong at $12,500, with an impressive 8.5% growth from last quarter. That's a fantastic boost to our revenue stream!

On the student front, we're up to 156 active learners, which is a significant increase. However, I do want to highlight that we have 8 students who are struggling a bit, so let's make sure to keep an eye on them and provide any necessary support.

Content-wise, we're in great shape with 14 clips ready to go and 21 scheduled for release. Our product development is also moving forward with three open PRs and the next release candidate v0.4.0 around the corner.

Last but not least, your calendar looks like this: two meetings today, starting with our team sync at 10:00 AM. You're all set!

So, what would you like to focus on first?
