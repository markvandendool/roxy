PROJECT: MindSong - The Musical Operating System

We're building the world's first PS5-grade music learning platform using WebGPU technology.
MindSong combines 3D visualization, AI-powered music generation, and real-time feedback to
make music theory accessible to everyone.

Current Status:
- 858K lines of production code
- 9-camera recording studio
- Working WebGPU visualizations (ChordCubes, Braid, Piano)
- Local AI infrastructure (Roxy)

Why Awesome:
Music education is stuck in the 1800s. We're bringing it to 2026 with browser-based,
GPU-accelerated learning that feels like playing a video game.

How $1,000 Helps:
- Server costs for public beta (3 months)
- Video production for tutorials
- Accessibility testing

Impact:
Every $1 spent reaches 10+ students. Our platform is free for individual learners,
funded by schools and institutions.

This is awesome because we're democratizing music education with cutting-edge technology
that didn't exist 2 years ago.

MINDSONG: DEMOCRATIZING MUSIC EDUCATION THROUGH WEBGPU TECHNOLOGY

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Current music education tools are:
• Expensive ($30-$50/month subscriptions)
• Single-instrument focused
• Limited visualization capabilities
• Inaccessible to students with learning differences
• Require powerful computers or apps

This creates a barrier for underserved communities and schools with limited budgets.

SOLUTION
MindSong is a browser-based Musical Operating System that provides:

1. Multi-Widget Visualization
   - 3D ChordCubes showing harmonic relationships
   - Real-time piano visualization
   - Guitar fretboard mapping
   - Circle of fifths interactive display
   - Braid (melodic pattern visualization)

2. AI-Powered Learning
   - NotaGen: AI music generation for practice tracks
   - Personalized feedback using local AI (no data privacy concerns)
   - Adaptive difficulty adjustment

3. Accessibility First
   - Works on any device with a browser
   - No downloads or installations
   - Free tier for individual students
   - Multiple learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

4. Cross-Instrument Learning
   - Students see the same musical concepts across piano, guitar, vocals
   - Theoretical understanding transfers between instruments
   - Encourages multi-instrumentalism

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION
MindSong leverages WebGPU (launched Nov 2025), enabling:
• 8K resolution at 120fps
• PS5-grade graphics in a browser
• No specialized hardware needed
• Instant access from Chromebooks or tablets

CURRENT STATUS
• 858,000+ lines of production code
• Passing 356+ automated tests
• Working prototype with 5 visualization widgets
• Recording studio with 9 cameras for tutorial content
• Local AI infrastructure (Roxy) for personalized learning

TARGET AUDIENCE
Primary: K-12 students in under-resourced schools
Secondary: Adult learners, music therapy programs, special education

BUDGET BREAKDOWN ($15,000 request)
• Cloud infrastructure (RunPod GPU): $3,000
• Accessibility testing & compliance: $4,000
• Curriculum development with music educators: $5,000
• Tutorial video production: $2,000
• User testing with 50 students: $1,000

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES (6 months)
• 500+ students using platform
• 3+ schools piloting in classrooms
• 85%+ student engagement rate
• Documented learning gains via pre/post assessment
• Open-source curriculum released

SUSTAINABILITY
Revenue model after grant period:
• Free for individual learners (always)
• $5/student/month for schools (bulk licensing)
• $99/year for premium features (AI generation, exports)
• Grant funding and sponsorships

IMPACT
Every dollar invested reaches 10 students. Our goal: make world-class music education
accessible to every student, regardless of zip code or income level.

We're not just building software—we're reimagining how humans learn music.

PROJECT TITLE: MindSong: Musical Operating System for Digital Natives

DISCIPLINE: Music Education / Technology

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
Browser-based music learning platform using WebGPU for real-time 3D visualization,
AI-powered generation, and multi-instrument pedagogy. Designed for accessibility,

are not decorative—they are pedagogical tools that make abstract musical concepts
(harmony, rhythm, form) tangible and interactive.

COMMUNITY IMPACT:
Free access for individual learners, affordable for schools. Targets underserved
communities without access to private music lessons or expensive software.

INNOVATION:
First platform to leverage WebGPU for music education. First to provide unified
cross-instrument learning. First with embedded AI generation for practice materials.
