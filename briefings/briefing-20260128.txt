"Good morning, Mark! I've got your daily briefing ready. The top priority is that our MRR has reached $12,500, which represents an impressive 8.5% growth over the past period. That's a great way to start the day!

On the student front, we're currently at 156 active students, with 8 of them showing signs of being at-risk. We'll need to keep a close eye on those students and provide additional support where needed.

Our content team has been busy, with 14 clips ready to go and another 21 scheduled for the near future. That's a lot of great material to work with!

On the product side, we've got three open PRs that need attention, and our next release is looking like v0.4.0.

As always, I've reviewed your calendar for today, and you've got two meetings lined up: the team sync at 10:00 AM, followed by... well, I won't spoil the rest just yet!

What would you like to focus on first?"
