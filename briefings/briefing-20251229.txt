"Good morning, Mark! I've got your daily briefing ready.

First off, let's start with the positives - our MRR is up 8.5% this month, which is fantastic news. You're doing great things!

Now, let's get to the numbers: we currently have 156 active students, and I'm keeping a close eye on the 8 at-risk ones. Our content team has got 14 clips ready to go and another 21 scheduled for the coming weeks.

On the product side, we've got three open PRs that need attention, and our next release is looking like v0.4.0. That's all good stuff!

Lastly, just a heads up on the calendar - you've got two meetings today, starting with the team sync at 10:00 AM.

So, what would you like to focus on first?"
