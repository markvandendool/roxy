# Governance Lock-In Moment

**Date:** 2025-12-12  
**Status:** ✅ **CONSTITUTIONAL LAYER ACTIVE**

---

## What Just Happened

This is not a documentation update. This is a **constitutional lock-in**.

Rocky governance is now **repo DNA**, not optional context.

---

## Four Leverage Points (All Active)

### 1. Canonical Brain Entry ✅

**File:** `docs/ROCKY_BRAIN.md`

- Central index of authority
- Routes all major concepts (contract, graph, enforcement, dashboard)
- Rocky is now **first-class cognitive spine**, not a feature

**Verification:**
- ✅ Created and linked from README
- ✅ Referenced in onboarding paths
- ✅ Tagged for RAG (`rocky-governance`)

---

### 2. Cultural Lock (Non-Negotiable) ✅

**File:** `docs/DOCTRINE.md`

**Constitutional Rule:**
> **No capability without graph + contract + violation zero**

This converts governance from "best practice" into **law**.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Doctrine file created
- ✅ Constitutional rule established
- ✅ Authority source declared (`RockyKnowledgeGraphService`)

---

### 3. Onboarding Hard-Gates ✅

**Files:**
- `README.md` → "Start Here: Rocky Cognitive Law"
- `docs/START_HERE_AGENTS.md` → Rocky Brain as mandatory step 8
- `docs/AGENT_FIRST_MESSAGE_CHECKLIST.md` → governance prerequisite
- `luno-orchestrator/skills/luno-orchestrator-bible/skill.md` → governance context injected

**Result:** No agent can act without first absorbing Rocky's law.

**Verification:**
- ✅ README updated with Rocky Brain section
- ✅ START_HERE_AGENTS.md includes Rocky Brain (step 8)
- ✅ AGENT_FIRST_MESSAGE_CHECKLIST.md includes Rocky Brain prerequisite
- ✅ Orchestrator Bible includes Rocky Brain governance context

---

### 4. RAG Spine Integration ✅

**File:** `docs/rag/ROCKY_RAG_INDEX.md`

**Tags:** `rocky-governance`, `cognitive-contract`, `tool-authority`, `knowledge-graph`

**Result:** Future AI reasoning is anchored in governance, not hallucinated summaries.

**Verification:**
- ✅ RAG index created
- ✅ Tags added to key governance docs
- ✅ Links to all governance components

---

## Architecture Map Integration ✅

**Command:** "Rocky Governance Dashboard" (Shift+G)

**Result:** Governance is co-equal with system architecture, discoverable, habitual, inspectable.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Command added to CommandPalette
- ✅ Panel state added to ArchitectureMapApp
- ✅ Handler wired in command routing

---

## What Is Now Structurally Impossible

These failure modes are **blocked by design**:

- ❌ "We added a tool quickly" → Must pass through graph + contract
- ❌ "This isn't documented yet" → Graph is documentation
- ❌ "The tests pass, ship it" → Contract tests are gate
- ❌ "Rocky said X but we don't know why" → Knowledge graph explains
- ❌ "The AI drifted over time" → Dashboard tracks drift

**Any future capability must pass through:**
**Graph → Contract → Enforcement → Snapshot → Review**

---

## Current Operating Truth (Frozen + Listening)

### Frozen (Do NOT Modify)
- 🔒 Cognitive Contract spec
- 🔒 Violation schema
- 🔒 Enforcement logic
- 🔒 Dashboard aggregation

### Active (Collecting Data)
- ✅ Test-time violations (CI/CD)
- ✅ Runtime soft enforcement (observation only)
- ✅ Snapshot generation (`pnpm governance:dashboard:7d`)

**Posture:** Listen. Do not tune. Do not optimize. Do not block.

---

## Rocky as Central Brain (What We Achieved)

Rocky is now:

- ✅ **Authoritative knowledge graph** (5,821 skills, 50+ tools)
- ✅ **Lawgiver for capability** (Cognitive Contract)
- ✅ **Arbiter of tool legitimacy** (Tool Authority tests)
- ✅ **Source of governance telemetry** (Runtime enforcement)
- ✅ **Entry point for agents, humans, and AI** (Onboarding gates)

**This is no longer "Rocky the tutor".**  
**This is Rocky the operating brain.**

## Next Steps (7-14 Day Listening Phase)

### Daily (2 minutes, no action)
- Confirm violations are being logged
- Check artifact generation
- Note patterns (don't react)

### Day 7
```bash
pnpm governance:dashboard:7d
```

**Review:**
- Compliance %
- Test vs runtime consistency
- Top 3 violating tools
- Trend direction

### Day 14
```bash
pnpm governance:dashboard:14d
```

**Compare:**
- Compliance trend (improving/stable/degrading)
- Consistency score trend
- Top violations (same or different?)

### After 14 Days
**Only then:**
- Select single low-risk tool
- Enable selective hard enforcement
- Design user-facing refusal UX

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Governance is **explicit**  
✅ Authority is **machine-checkable**  
✅ Onboarding is **self-correcting**  
✅ Repo **teaches new agents how to behave**

## When Ready

Say: **"Review snapshot #1."**

That's when we move from listening to strategy.
