## Content Fit Analysis

### Your Niche: Tech/AI/Automation + Guitar Teaching
**Best platforms:**
- YouTube Shorts: Perfect for quick tutorials
- TikTok: "Here's what I learned today" format
- Twitter: Code snippets, tips, engage with tech community
- Reddit: Deep dives, troubleshooting help
- LinkedIn: Professional credibility, networking
- Twitch: Live coding/music sessions
- Gumroad: Sell automation scripts, templates

**Avoid:**
- Facebook (older demographic, low tech engagement)
- Pinterest (visual/lifestyle, not tech)
- Snapchat (too young, ephemeral doesn't fit tutorials)
