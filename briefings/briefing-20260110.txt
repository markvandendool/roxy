"Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready. First and foremost, our MRR is looking strong at $12,500, with an 8.5% growth - that's a great way to start the day! Our active student count is up to 156, although we do have eight students who are at-risk of falling behind. On the content front, we've got 14 clips ready to roll and another 21 scheduled for release soon.

In terms of product development, we're keeping busy with three open PRs, and our next release, v0.4.0, is right around the corner. As for your calendar, you've got a team sync meeting at 10:00 AM today - make sure to block that out!

That's the latest from Roxy. What would you like to focus on first?"
