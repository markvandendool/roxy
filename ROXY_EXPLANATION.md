# 🔍 ROXY Current Status Explanation

**Date**: January 1, 2026  
**Status**: Active with high CPU usage from indexing

## 📊 What's Happening Right Now

### 1. **High CPU Usage (1371% CPU)**

**Process**: `python3 scripts/index_mindsong_repo.py` (PID 2941107)  
**Runtime**: 17 hours 33 minutes  
**CPU Usage**: 1371% (using ~14 CPU cores)

**What it's doing**: 
- Indexing the `mindsong-juke-hub` repository for ROXY's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- This is NOT training ROXY - it's building a semantic search index
- The index allows ROXY to instantly find and retrieve relevant code/files when you ask questions
- This is a ONE-TIME operation that takes a long time for large repositories

**Why it's using so much CPU**:
- Processing thousands of files
- Extracting code, comments, and documentation
- Creating embeddings (vector representations) for semantic search
- Storing everything in ChromaDB for fast retrieval

**Is this normal?**: ✅ YES - This is expected behavior for initial indexing

**When will it finish?**: 
- Depends on repository size
- Check progress: `ps -p 2941107 -o etime,%cpu`
- Once complete, CPU usage will drop to normal

### 2. **ROXY Still Using LLM Instead of File Operations**

**Problem**: ROXY is generating responses with the LLM instead of using real file operations for "list" queries.

**Root Cause**: 
- The file operation check was too restrictive (required exact repo path)
- Logic flaw: If repo path doesn't exist, it falls through to LLM
- The condition checking was inverted/confusing

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ File operations now check FIRST before LLM
- ✅ More flexible path detection (tries multiple locations)
- ✅ Clearer logic: Skip LLM if it's clearly a file operation request
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

**How to Test**:
```bash
roxy chat
# Then ask: "list pages" or "list files"
# ROXY should now return REAL files from the filesystem
```

## 🏗️ ROXY Architecture

### Current Flow (After Fix)

```
User: "list pages"
  ↓
1. Detect "list" + "page" keywords ✅
  ↓
2. Check for file operations FIRST ✅
  ↓
3. If repo path found:
   → Scan filesystem for actual files ✅
   → Return real file list ✅
  ↓
4. If file operations fail:
   → Fall back to LLM (but with warning) ⚠️
  ↓
5. If NOT a file operation request:
   → Use LLM for intelligent response ✅
```

### Priority Order (Fixed)

1. **PRIORITY 0**: File operations for "list" queries (BEFORE LLM)
2. **PRIORITY 1**: LLM for general queries (NOT file operations)
3. **PRIORITY 2**: RAG system (if repository is indexed)
4. **PRIORITY 3**: Pattern matching fallbacks

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Code Changes

1. **File Operation Detection**:
   - Now checks for "list" + "page/file/component" FIRST
   - More flexible path detection
   - Better error handling

2. **LLM Usage Prevention**:
   - Clear condition: Skip LLM if it's a file operation request
   - Prevents hallucination for file listing queries

3. **Path Detection**:
   - Tries multiple repository locations
   - Falls back to `/opt/roxy` if specific repo not found
   - Better logging for debugging

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Current System Load

- **CPU**: High (from indexing process)
- **Memory**: Normal (~20GB used, 137GB available)
- **I/O**: Moderate (indexing reads many files)
- **Network**: Low

### After Indexing Completes

- **CPU**: Will drop to normal (<10%)
- **Memory**: Will stabilize
- **I/O**: Will decrease
- **ROXY Response Time**: Will improve (can use indexed data)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait for indexing to complete** (or stop it if needed)
2. **Test ROXY file operations**: Ask "list pages" and verify it returns real files
3. **Monitor CPU usage**: Should drop once indexing finishes
4. **Use ROXY normally**: Once indexed, RAG will make responses much better

## 🛑 How to Stop Indexing (If Needed)

```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep index_mindsong

# Stop it (if needed)
kill 2941107

# Or let it finish (recommended - it's a one-time operation)
```

## ✅ Verification

After the fix, test ROXY:

```bash
roxy chat
```

Ask: **"list pages in the project"**

**Expected**: Real file list from filesystem  
**Before Fix**: Hallucinated list from LLM  
**After Fix**: ✅ Real files

**Status**: Fix applied, indexing in progress, ROXY should now use file operations correctly.
