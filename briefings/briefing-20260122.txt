Good morning, Mark! I've got your daily briefing ready.

First off, let's start with the good stuff - our MRR is up 8.5% from last quarter, hitting $12,500. That's a great sign of momentum, and we should keep an eye on that growth to see where it takes us.

Now, let's talk about our active students. We've got 156 learners enrolled, with 8 currently at-risk. I know we're all working hard to support those students and get them back on track. Our content team has been doing a fantastic job too - they've got 14 clips ready to go, with another 21 scheduled for the next quarter.

On the product side, we have three open PRs that need our attention. Our next release is v0.4.0, and I know the team is eager to get it out the door. Finally, let's take a look at the calendar - we've got two meetings today, with the first one being our team sync at 10:00 AM.

That's your morning briefing, Mark! What would you like to focus on first?
