"Hey Mark, morning! I've got a quick update for you. First, let's start with the good stuff - our MRR is looking strong at $12,500, up 8.5% from last month. That's a great sign of growth and momentum.

On the student front, we're at 156 active learners, which is impressive. However, I do want to flag that we have eight students who are at-risk, so let's make sure we're keeping an eye on those profiles.

Moving on to content, we've got 14 clips ready to go and another 21 scheduled for the next few weeks. That should keep our pipeline full and give us some flexibility if needed.

In product land, we have three open PRs and are gearing up for our next release, v0.4.0. Looking good so far!

As always, our calendar is packed with meetings - just one today at 10:00 AM, a team sync to get everyone aligned. What would you like to focus on first?"
