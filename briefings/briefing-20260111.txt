Good morning, Mark! I've got your morning briefing ready. Let's start with the highlights - our monthly recurring revenue is up 8.5% to $12,500, which is fantastic news.

Now, let's take a look at our student engagement. We have a total of 156 active students, and while that's great, I do want to flag that we've got eight students who are at-risk of not completing their courses. We'll need to keep an eye on them and make sure they're getting the support they need.

On the content front, we've got 14 clips ready to go, with 21 more scheduled for release in the coming days. That's a lot of engaging material to share with our students!

Moving on to product development, we have three open PRs that need attention, and our next release is slated for v0.4.0.

Finally, let me remind you that you've got two meetings today - a team sync at 10:00 AM. Make sure to clear your schedule and be prepared to dive in on those discussions.

So, what would you like to focus on first?
