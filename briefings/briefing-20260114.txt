Hey Mark! Good morning! I've got your morning briefing ready.

First off, let me highlight that we're seeing a fantastic 8.5% growth in our monthly recurring revenue, which now stands at $12,500. That's some amazing momentum!

On the student front, we've got a total of 156 active learners, with 8 currently considered at-risk. We'll need to keep an eye on those and make sure they're getting the support they need.

In terms of content, we've got 14 clips ready to go, and another 21 scheduled for release in the coming days. That's a lot of fresh material to engage our students!

On the product side, we've got three open PRs, with our next major release, v0.4.0, on the horizon.

Finally, let me remind you that you've got two meetings today, starting with our team sync at 10:00 AM.

So, what would you like to focus on first?
